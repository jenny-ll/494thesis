This repository contains scripts for generating the final dataset used for estimations, as well as all intermediate datasets. Data sources used in order:

1. EXIOBASE 3: a time series of environmentally extended multi-regional input‐output (EE MRIO) tables for 44 countries (28 EU member plus 16 major economies) and five rest of the world regions.
2. BACI: yearly data on bilateral trade flows at the product level (HS6 code)
3. Aljaz Kuncic's Institutional Quality Dataset: covering up to 197 countries and territories from 1990 to 2010. Kuncic utilizes over 30 established institutional indicators and clusters them into three general categories: legal, political and economic.

The order of the scripts are from Organize Exiobase -> Trade -> Trade2 -> FilterIQ -> IQ.
